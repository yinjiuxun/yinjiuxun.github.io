### 1. Separation of seismic signal

Earthquake signals in seismic data are inevitably contaminated with signals from unwanted sources. Separating noise from earthquake signals can greatly improve seismic data analysis, such as earthquake characterization and ambient noise analysis. This work develops a machine learning method to extract transient signals from ambient signals directly in the time domain for 3-component seismograms. We explore the generalization of our time-domain denoiser by training on various scales of seismic data. For example, we train purely on observed seismograms of local ( < 350 km) events using the STandford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD) data set. We also generate a data set for regional earthquakes (350 km-2000 km), combining realistic noises and seismograms generated by deterministic synthetic waveforms. We explore different types of network architectures to look for the best model. Our preliminary results show that our method can successfully separate the earthquake signal and noise signal directly in the time domain, even for the cases of low SNR or when the earthquake and noise signals overlap in frequency domain. This tool has potential to greatly improve the quality of seismic data. This is a on-going work and we keep updating the model and results, please stay tuned!
