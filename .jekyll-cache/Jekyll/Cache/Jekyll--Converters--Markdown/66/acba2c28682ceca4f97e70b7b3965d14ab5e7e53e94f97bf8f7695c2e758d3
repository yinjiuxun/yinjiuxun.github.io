<p>We develop a methodology that combines the backprojection (BP) and source spectral analysis (SP) of teleseismic P waves to provide metrics relevant to earthquake dynamics of large events. We improve the compressive sensing backprojection (CS-BP) method (Yao et al., 2011; Yin &amp; Yao, 2016) by an auto-adaptive source grid refinement as well as a reference source adjustment technique to increase spatial and temporal resolution of the locations of the radiated bursts. We also use a two-step source spectral analysis based on (i) simple theoretical Greenâ€™s functions that include depth phases and water reverberations and on (ii) empirical P-wave Greenâ€™s functions. Furthermore, we propose a source spectrogram methodology that provides the temporal evolution of dynamic parameters such as radiated energy and falloff rates. Combination of BP and SP analysis provides a spatial and temporal evolution of these dynamic source parameters and is an attempt to bridge kinematic observations with earthquake dynamics.
