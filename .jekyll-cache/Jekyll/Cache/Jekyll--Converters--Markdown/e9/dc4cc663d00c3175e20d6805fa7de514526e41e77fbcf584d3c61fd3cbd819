<h3 id="4-global-patterns-of-stf-complexity">4. Global patterns of STF complexity</h3>
<p>We developed different metrics to look at the complexity patterns of earthquake source time functions (STFs) in the global database (specifically <a href="http://scardec.projects.sismo.ipgp.fr/#">SCARDEC</a> database):</p>

<p>(1) Gaussian-subevent decomposition 
We decompose the STF as a sum of “subevents” that are Gaussian pulses. We iteratively perform the subevent decomposition from onset of rupture (time zero): searching for the best-fit Guassian pulse for the first peak, then subtracting that Gaussian subdevent from the STF, repeating this for the residual until no obvious peaks can be found. In this way, we can quantify the STF complexity with the number and magnitudes of those subtracted Gaussian subevents. A very clear scaling pattern has been found between the main event magnitude and corresponding subevent magnitudes. Applying this to early magnitude estimates, we show that the main event magnitude can be estimated after observing only the first few subevents (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083093">here</a> for more details please).</p>

<h3 id="3-backprojection-resolution-from-the-theoretical-formulation">3. Backprojection resolution from the theoretical formulation</h3>

<p>Based on the theoreitcal formulation of linear back projection (see <a href="/explanations.html">here</a>), the resolution matrix F(ω) only depends on source mechanism and source-receiver geometry, we can further calculate the resolvability, which is defined as the 2D correlation coefficient between the resolution matrix and an identity matrix, and use it to evaluate the BP resolutions for real seismic array-source configurations. For more details, please see Yin and Denolle (2019 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-abstract/217/2/729/5301380">GJI</a>).</p>

<p><em>BP resolvability for most of the seismic arrays in the world. The higher resolvability implies better BP resolution for a specific seismic array towards a seismic region.</em></p>

<p>We develop a methodology that combines the backprojection (BP) and source spectral analysis (SP) of teleseismic P waves to provide metrics relevant to earthquake dynamics of large events. We improve the compressive sensing backprojection (CS-BP) method (Yao et al., 2011; Yin &amp; Yao, 2016) by an auto-adaptive source grid refinement as well as a reference source adjustment technique to increase spatial and temporal resolution of the locations of the radiated bursts. We also use a two-step source spectral analysis based on (i) simple theoretical Green’s functions that include depth phases and water reverberations and on (ii) empirical P-wave Green’s functions. Furthermore, we propose a source spectrogram methodology that provides the temporal evolution of dynamic parameters such as radiated energy and falloff rates. Combination of BP and SP analysis provides a spatial and temporal evolution of these dynamic source parameters and is an attempt to bridge kinematic observations with earthquake dynamics. For more details, please see Yin et al. (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JB014265">2018 JGR</a>).</p>
