<h3 id="2-systematic-variation-of-the-stf-complexity-with-frictional-properties">2. Systematic variation of the STF complexity with frictional properties</h3>

<p>Using our dynamic simulations with stochastic prestress distributions, we further explore the possible dynamic factors that can change the variability of STFs. Specifically, we look at the frictional properties represented by the linear slip weakening friction. Here, we focus on varying the $D_c$ on fault interface, yet aware of the trade-off between strength excess and $D_c$ in controlling rupture velocity and the resulting ground motions. While we keep $D_c$ constant within a single set of simulations, we carry several sets of experiments with values  of $D_c$ at various levels 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 m that are within bounds found in the literature.</p>

<p>For each $D_c$, we first generate a set of pre-stress distributions that we use in each simulations. Then we perform the hierarchical clustering and group the simulated STFs for each $D_c$, following the same procedures as for the <a href="http://scardec.projects.sismo.ipgp.fr/#">SCARDEC</a> STFs. Our results reveal a monotonic pattern that higher $D_c$ values produce larger proportion of complex STFs with multiple prominent peaks after stretching. In contrast, lower $D_c$ values produce mostly simple STFs with only one prominent peak after stretching. Those results are helpful to further constrain the rupture dynamics from the population behavior of large number of STFs.</p>

<p>Our results indicate that the small values of $D_c &lt; 0.1$ m are necessary to produce the general level of complexity of the SCARDEC STFs. When binning these relative contributions with source depths, we find that crustal events (h $\leq$ 40 km), which show a higher degree of complexity, could be explained by a larger $D_c$ value than the deeper events. This is more pronounced with the upper-crustal depths (h $\leq$ 20 km).</p>

<p>Simulations of dynamic ruptures using stochastic distributions of fault-interface parameters are popular in the investigations of complex kinematic source models, realistic fault geometry and roughness models, and to simulate high-frequency ground motions. In order to investigate possible factors that control diverse patterns of earthquake variability and complexity, we generate statistically similar shear pre-stress $\tau_0(\mathbf{r})$ distributions on the fault plane. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of pre-stress on the fault is constrained to follow a power-law amplitude distribution that approximates the scenario caused by natural fault roughness (e.g., Candela et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JB009041">2012</a>).</p>

<p>Currently our synthetic dynamic sources are generated in a 2-dimensional medium in an anti-plane setting. With properly chosen constitutive relation as well as nucleations, we can efficiently generate large number of dynamic models and explore the statistical patterns of those models. In our two STF projects (Danr√© et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083093">2019</a>; Yin et al., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10503349.1">2020</a>), we find that this is an effective way to reproduce the large STF variablity observed in the real world.</p>
