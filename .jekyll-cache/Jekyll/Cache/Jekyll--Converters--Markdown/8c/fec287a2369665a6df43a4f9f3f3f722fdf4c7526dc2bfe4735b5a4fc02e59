<p>Simulations of dynamic ruptures using stochastic distributions of fault-interface parameters are popular in the investigations of complex kinematic source models, realistic fault geometry and roughness models, and to simulate high-frequency ground motions. In order to investigate possible factors that control diverse patterns of earthquake variability and complexity, we generate statistically similar shear pre-stress $\tau_0(\overrightarrow{r})$ distributions on the fault plane. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of pre-stress on the fault is constrained to follow a power-law amplitude distribution that approximates the scenario caused by natural fault roughness (e.g., Candela et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JB009041">2012</a>).</p>

<p>In our current studies, synthetic dynamic sources are generated in a 2-dimensional medium in an anti-plane setting.</p>

<p>We assume a constant normal stress of 120 MPa and linear slip weakening friction law  \cite{andrews_rupture_1976}. Linear slip weakening requires three parameters: the static friction coefficient (here chosen as $\mu_s = 0.677$), the dynamic friction coefficient (here chosen as $\mu_d = 0.525$), and the characteristic slip-weakening distance $D_c$. We set up the experiments so that the fault-average stress drop is about 1 MPa (Figure S7).</p>
