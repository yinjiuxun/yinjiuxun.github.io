<p>Simulations of dynamic ruptures using stochastic distributions of fault-interface parameters are popular in the investigations of complex kinematic source models, realistic fault geometry and roughness models, and to simulate high-frequency ground motions. In order to investigate possible factors that control diverse patterns of earthquake variability and complexity, we generate statistically similar shear pre-stress $\tau_0(\mathbf{r})$ distributions on the fault plane. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of pre-stress on the fault is constrained to follow a power-law amplitude distribution that approximates the scenario caused by natural fault roughness (e.g., Candela et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JB009041">2012</a>).</p>

<p>Currently our synthetic dynamic sources are generated in a 2-dimensional medium in an anti-plane setting. With properly chosen constitutive relation as well as nucleations, we can efficiently generate large number of dynamic models and explore the statistical patterns of those models. In our two STF projects (Danr√© et al., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083093">2019</a>; Yin et al., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10503349.1">2020</a>), we find that this is an effective way to reproduce the large STF variablity observed in the real world.</p>
